How to implement ExtentReports
------------------
Third Party reports

Setup
-----
1) we need to download extent reports jars along with extent-config.xml
	https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EXYQHO-QFUgUo10KnxPAjBYe1i3M6y9b

2) add all the jars to your project build path and copy the extent-config.xml file in to project home directory.

3) Create test case/s
4) Implement listener class ( Written teh code for generating extent report)
5) Integrate them in to testng xml file
6) Execute test xml file which will generate extent report
